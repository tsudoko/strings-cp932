     NAME
          strings-cp932 - extract printable windows-31j/cp932 strings

     SYNOPSIS
          strings-cp932 [-t format] [file...]

     DESCRIPTION
          Strings-cp932 finds and prints strings containing printable
          Windows-31J-encoded characters in a file, default standard
          input. Printable characters are taken to be ASCII characters
          from blank through tilde (hexadecimal 20 through 7E),
          inclusive, and all other characters defined in the Windows-
          31J character set. If -t is passed, strings-cp932 prepends
          file offsets to found strings. The format argument passed to
          -t can be d for decimal offsets, x for hexadecimal offsets
          or o for octal offsets.

     BUGS
          -n is not supported for now; even 1-character strings are
          printed. You can pipe the output of strings-cp932 to awk
          'length($0)>n'  (or awk 'length($0)-length($1)-1>n' if
          you're using -t) where n is the desired minimum length if
          you want to filter out shorter strings.
